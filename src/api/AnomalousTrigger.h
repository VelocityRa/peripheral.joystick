  /*!
   * \brief Filter for anomalous triggers
   *
   * Most gamepad triggers report a value in the interval [0.0, 1.0], where 0.0
   * is depressed and 1.0 is fully pressed.
   *
   * Anomalous triggers, when depressed, have a value of -1.0 or 1.0. When
   * fully pressed, the value can either be zero or the depressed value's
   * opposite.
   *
   * Some APIs, such as cocoa, are event-driven and do not report an initial
   * value. We assume that the triggers are depressed when the controller is
   * detected and that the initial perturbation is small. An anomaly is
   * detected if the initial value is close to -1.0 or 1.0.
   *
   * At first, the trigger is expected to range between its center value and
   * zero. When a value is encountered that lies in the opposite semiaxis, the
   * range is updated to include the full interval [-1.0, 1.0].
   *
   * Triggers centered about -1.0 are transformed to travel from zero to 1.0.
   *
   * Triggers centered about 1.0 are transformed to travel from zero to -1.0.
